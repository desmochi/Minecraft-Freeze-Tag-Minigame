# Minecraft-Freeze-Tag-Minigame

Hello!
In order to run this little mini-game you must export the project code as a .jar file and download Spigot for a Minecraft server. This is a multiplayer game so it functions
as it should only when there are multiple players. Enjoy the mini-game and I hope you have fun!
